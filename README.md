# Face-Detection-using-OpenCv
Face Detection is a process that involves identifying the face of a person in an image or video by analyzing the visual input which helps to determine whether the person's facial features are present.
The detection model is usually trained on a large amount of input data as human faces are diverse and features vary from person to person.
In this project Haar Cascade Classifier is used.The Haar Cascade Classifier is a pre-trained classifier having a cascade function which is trained from a set of images with faces and images without faces.

In order to perform face detection ,follow the steps as mentioned below:

Step 1:Open the terminal and then activate the virtual environment.

Step 2:Enter the command "python <file_name.py>".
